One can create a new dataset with ‘datalad create [–description] PATH’. The dataset is created empty
The command "datalad save [-m] PATH" saves the file
(modifications) to history. Note to self:
Always use informative, concise commit messages.

The datalad run command can record the impact a script or command has on a Dataset.
In its simplest form, datalad run only takes a commit message and the command that
should be executed.

Any datalad run command can be re-executed by using its commit shasum as an argument
in datalad rerun CHECKSUM. DataLad will take information from the run record of the original
commit, and re-execute it. If no changes happen with a rerun, the command will not be written
to history. Note: you can also rerun a datalad rerun command!
